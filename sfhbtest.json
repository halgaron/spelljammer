                        "Sphere Agents have the right, under letters of marque, to legally stop any ship within their home port's sphere of control. 'Home port' need not be a planet; it could be a fixed base or even a fleet mothership. Within the sphere of control, the Sphere Agents may legally stop vessels, board them, assess customs duties, and seize contraband. This also gives you the right of passage and safe harbor throughout your home port and system with entities that are friendly to your nation. Agents who follow the rules are typically more respected and are coined as 'Corsairs'.",
                        "Contraband may be any item that is illegal to import or export, or an item for which the proper taxes have not been paid. In addition, at the DM's discretion, there may be certain enemy nations whose ships are always confiscated (such as the neogi). Of course, not every ship is going to peacefully await boarding. A neogi deathspider is unlikely to quietly acquiesce to such an action; if the neogi do allow boarding, a Sphere Agents captain can be assured of an ambush. The only real meaning of this power is that law-abiding ships will comply, and any hostile action taken against other ships will probably be supported by the Sphere Agents's commanders back home. Sphere Agents keep 10% of the contraband cargo seized and taxes collected to pay expenses and reward the crew. Sphere Agents who abuse their titles are considered privateers. Typically these privateers withhold more than 10%, risking discovery and prosecution.",
                        "In exchange for the above privileges, The Sphere Agents must return to his home port regularly (at least every six months) to report on his activities, and of course must give 90% of the value of cargoes and ships he seizes to his command at that base. In addition, the home base may choose to send the Sphere Agents on missions that he must undertake. The cost of mounting the mission (including paying her crew) is borne by the Sphere Agents, although as with all of her other activities he may keep 10% of what he finds. Finally, Sphere Agents are obligated to defend the home base. This can be a great disadvantage when the neogi show up and the Sphere Agents would much prefer to head for safer climes. "

If the Crusader is a military officer, he's subject to the orders of his superiors and the priesthood, and bears the added stress of having to look after his men whenever they're engaged in military action. Also, many faiths do not restrict their requests to simple military actions.

The Frontiersman lives at the fringes of civilized space, taming worlds and finding out what lies just beyond the phlogiston. Frontiersmen tend to be solitary or bound into tight-knit groups. As a rule, they distrust strangers and are more willing to depend on themselves than any whims of fate or pleas to fair treatment. They are pragmatic and sometimes seen as unnecessarily heartless by their more civilized brethren, but they are generally not unnecessarily cruel. The Frontiersman often represents his civilization in first contacts with new races and peoples. While most Frontiersmen toil their whole lives without distinction, a few discover one of the many natural troves of space (uninhabited worlds with rich resources), becoming wealthier than the wealthiest adventurer. The Frontiersman is the explorer, expanding society's horizons for the good of his soul (and for his profit, of course). Without Frontiersmen, the Known Spheres would not be known, and the many uninhabited worlds of space would sit idle. "

The Marine commander is subservient only to the ship's captain, and has considerable independence in how he conducts his affairs. Famous Marine organizations include the Kintiara of the elven Imperial Fleet (which many believe to be the finest force of Marines in the Known Spheres), the Scro Brethren of the Knife (who man the dread scro battlewagons), and the Wing Jen Sen of the Shou dragonships. The giff military considers all their troops to be Marines.  Marines serve organized military space naval forces, providing the muscle for hand-to-hand battle.
