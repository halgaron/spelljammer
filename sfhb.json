Traditionally called 'Corsairs', they are semiofficial agents of the law of their systems (or perhaps of only a single nation within the system), traveling under letters of marque with “authorization to attack and board suspicious or known criminal vessels and bring the booty home. Corsairs are the customs agents, border patrol, and first line of defense for many spacefaring worlds. When entering a sphere with spacefaring civilizations, the Corsair is often the first character you meet. Despite their legal role, Corsairs are not always lawful. They pursue their enemies (who may merely fly the flag of a rival nation), capture their ships and treasure, and return a portion (sometimes a small portion) to their home nations. Corsairs' letters of marque lose significance the farther they get from their homes. Generally speaking, a Corsair's right to intercept other vessels terminates at the edge of his home sphere. (In spheres with multiple spacefaring civilizations, the zone of control may be even smaller.) Some Corsairs, particularly those who are pirates on the side, do not stop at their official borders ard are refferred to as 'privateers'. Their ability to get away with their activities depends on their strength and speed. Corsairs are the law in wildspace. When operating as agents of the law, stopping true smugglers or pirates, they are respected within their sphere, and sometimes in other 'nearby' spheres. When they engage in piracy “When they engage in piracy under cover of their police powers, they are reviled. One's opinion of a Corsair or Privateer depends on whether you are the beneficiary or the victim."

                        "Sphere Agents have the right, under letters of marque, to legally stop any ship within their home port's sphere of control. 'Home port' need not be a planet; it could be a fixed base or even a fleet mothership. Within the sphere of control, the Sphere Agents may legally stop vessels, board them, assess customs duties, and seize contraband. This also gives you the right of passage and safe harbor throughout your home port and system with entities that are friendly to your nation. Agents who follow the rules are typically more respected and are coined as 'Corsairs'.",
                        "Contraband may be any item that is illegal to import or export, or an item for which the proper taxes have not been paid. In addition, at the DM's discretion, there may be certain enemy nations whose ships are always confiscated (such as the neogi). Of course, not every ship is going to peacefully await boarding. A neogi deathspider is unlikely to quietly acquiesce to such an action; if the neogi do allow boarding, a Sphere Agents captain can be assured of an ambush. The only real meaning of this power is that law-abiding ships will comply, and any hostile action taken against other ships will probably be supported by the Sphere Agents's commanders back home. Sphere Agents keep 10% of the contraband cargo seized and taxes collected to pay expenses and reward the crew. Sphere Agents who abuse their titles are considered privateers. Typically these privateers withhold more than 10%, risking discovery and prosecution.",
                        "In exchange for the above privileges, The Sphere Agents must return to his home port regularly (at least every six months) to report on his activities, and of course must give 90% of the value of cargoes and ships he seizes to his command at that base. In addition, the home base may choose to send the Sphere Agents on missions that he must undertake. The cost of mounting the mission (including paying her crew) is borne by the Sphere Agents, although as with all of her other activities he may keep 10% of what he finds. Finally, Sphere Agents are obligated to defend the home base. This can be a great disadvantage when the neogi show up and the Sphere Agents would much prefer to head for safer climes. "

The Frontiersman lives at the fringes of civilized space, taming worlds and finding out what lies just beyond the phlogiston. Frontiersmen tend to be solitary or bound into tight-knit groups. As a rule, they distrust strangers and are more willing to depend on themselves than any whims of fate or pleas to fair treatment. They are pragmatic and sometimes seen as unnecessarily heartless by their more civilized brethren, but they are generally not unnecessarily cruel. The Frontiersman often represents his civilization in first contacts with new races and peoples. While most Frontiersmen toil their whole lives without distinction, a few discover one of the many natural troves of space (uninhabited worlds with rich resources), becoming wealthier than the wealthiest adventurer. The Frontiersman is the explorer, expanding society's horizons for the good of his soul (and for his profit, of course). Without Frontiersmen, the Known Spheres would not be known, and the many uninhabited worlds of space would sit idle. "

The Marine commander is subservient only to the ship's captain, and has considerable independence in how he conducts his affairs.

The giff military considers all their troops to be Marines.  Marines serve organized military space naval forces, providing the muscle for hand-to-hand battle.

At this level, they receive only a small commissions of any sale.

The Medi-cus's knowledge of medicine allows him to ply his skills with all the races of space, and the nonmagical component of this skills allows the Medicus to treat injuries and wounds on long trips through the phlogiston, where magical healing is unrenewable. The Medicus feels a commitment to the sanctity of life and the avoidance of suffering. This commitment applies even to enemies. While a Medicus will not prevent his comrades from defending themselves or attacking a heinous foe, and may even participate in the battle, he will want to treat all of the survivors regardless of what side they fought on. In the absence of large temples and the complete stocks of herbs that can be found on planetary surfaces, the Medicus is the mainstay of injury repair in the Known Spheres. Any large vessel, especially those that ferry passengers across the Void, carries its own Medicus."

Most of their thievery takes the form of con games or minor pick-pocketing. They are the gypsies of the Known Spheres and forever search for new opportunities. Generally, Aperusa travel with their clan in large ramshackle ships. Occasionally, a member of the clan will strike out on his own, seeking adventure and fun. On these voyages, the Aperusa will hook up with adventurers or anyone else who can take him to the next system for the next scam. No one quite knows whether these individuals are clan exiles or spies sent out by the clan leaders. The Aperusa are not telling. The Aperusa are space gypsies. They are not truly a separate species from humanity (as any number of jilted lovers on a hundred worlds will tell you), but rather a close-knit family group with their own special perspective on life. Aperusa are lovers, not fighters. While they are allowed to use weapons, most will defer, instead offering 'once in a lifetime' deals on healing potions and protective charms to their defenders."

The Salvager searches crystal spheres, particularly those that have been the site of a space battle or are plagued with pirates or hazardous space creatures, looking for ships that can no longer navigate under their own power. The Salvager then grapples with the derelict ship and recovers any valuables left aboard. Ideally, derelict ships are also unoccupied. A Salvager who comes across a derelict with living crew (which can easily happen in the preserving bath of the phlogiston) may return the survivors to a nearby spaceport. Their valuables, however, are never seen again. “Some few Salvagers lack the patience to wait for a vessel to become a derelict. These have no scruples against helping the process along by doubling as pirates. Most of these are not so solicitous of the survivors of their attacks."
