'Home port' need not be a planet; it could be a fixed base or even a fleet mothership. Within the sphere of control, the Corsair may legally stop vessels, board them, assess customs duties, and seize contraband. This also gives you the right of passage and safe harbor throughout your home port and system with entities that are friendly to your nation.",
                        "Contraband may be any item that is illegal to import or export, or an item for which the proper taxes have not been paid. In addition, at the DM's discretion, there may be certain enemy nations whose ships are always confiscated (such as the neogi). Of course, not every ship is going to peacefully await boarding. A neogi deathspider is unlikely to quietly acquiesce to such an action; if the neogi do allow boarding, a Corsair captain can be assured of an ambush. The only real meaning of this power is that law-abiding ships will comply, and any hostile action taken against other ships will probably be supported by the Corsair's commanders back home. Corsairs keep 10% of the contraband cargo seized and taxes collected to pay expenses and reward the crew. Some Corsairs withhold more than 10%, risking discovery and prosecution. ",
                        "In exchange for the above privileges, The Corsair must return to his home port regularly (at least every six months) to report on his activities, and of course must give 90% of the value of cargoes and ships he seizes to his command at that base. In addition, the home base may choose to send the Corsair on missions that he must undertake. The cost of mounting the mission (including paying her crew) is borne by the Corsair, although as with all of her other activities he may keep 10% of what he finds. Finally, Corsairs are obligated to defend the home base. This can be a great disadvantage when the neogi show up and the Corsair would much prefer to head for safer climes. "

Also, many faiths do not restrict their requests to simple military actions.

The Frontiersman lives at the fringes of civilized space, taming worlds and finding out what lies just beyond the phlogiston. Frontiersmen tend to be solitary or bound into tight-knit groups. As a rule, they distrust strangers and are more willing to depend on themselves than any whims of fate or pleas to fair treatment. They are pragmatic and sometimes seen as unnecessarily heartless by their more civilized brethren, but they are generally not unnecessarily cruel. The Frontiersman often represents his civilization in first contacts with new races and peoples. While most Frontiersmen toil their whole lives without distinction, a few discover one of the many natural troves of space (uninhabited worlds with rich resources), becoming wealthier than the wealthiest adventurer. The Frontiersman is the explorer, expanding society's horizons for the good of his soul (and for his profit, of course). Without Frontiersmen, the Known Spheres would not be known, and the many uninhabited worlds of space would sit idle. "

The Marine commander is subservient only to the ship's captain, and has considerable independence in how he conducts his affairs.

The giff military considers all their troops to be Marines.  Marines serve organized military space naval forces, providing the muscle for hand-to-hand battle.

They may be a driven seeker of hidden wisdom or a spaceborne tourist, sampling the pleasures of every world they visits. The Astronomer is a source of information. His studies and travels give his insight into the nature of the planets and the crystal spheres, and his breadth of experience makes him a valued travel companion. Like any scholar, however, the Astronomer is sometimes perceived as an ineffectual bystander. This is by no means universally true."
