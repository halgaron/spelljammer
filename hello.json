In their travels, the Astronomer gains many insights into the workings of the spheres. They may be a driven seeker of hidden wisdom or a spaceborne tourist, sampling the pleasures of every world they visits. The Astronomer is a source of information. His studies and travels give his insight into the nature of the planets and the crystal spheres, and his breadth of experience makes him a valued travel companion and are ideal navigators on a spelljammer vessel. Like any scholar, however, the Astronomer is sometimes perceived as an ineffectual bystander. This is by no means universally true."

Even the great starbeasts demonstrate that the power of the true gods is beyond human comprehension. The Astrologer studies the movements of the spheres to determine the will of the gods. Thus, their strength lies in his knowledge of Known Space and his understanding of the principles upon which the universe itself is built."
